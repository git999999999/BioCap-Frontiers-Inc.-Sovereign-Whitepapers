Preamble:

The mechanism of the Agile Exchange is a deterministic, harmonic sequence connecting:

1. The Harmonic Gate
2. The Physical–Digital Equivalence Chain (PD-Chain)
3. The 3-6-9 Identity Field

THE HARMONIC GATE
The lawful point of entry for all system operations.
It evaluates identity, boundary, and equivalence before allowing action.

PD-CHAIN
Anchors system events to physical reality through deterministic equivalence.
A digital action is only valid when its physical corollary is proven harmonic.

3-6-9 IDENTITY FIELD
Classifies every identity in the system using harmonic structure.
Ensures sovereignty, reduces dimensional error, and prevents simulations.

Together, these components form a closed, sovereign, unforgeable system.
