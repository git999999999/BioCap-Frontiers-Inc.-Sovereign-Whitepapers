Preamble:

The Agile Exchange issues an open challenge to the global engineering,
cryptographic, and academic communities:

Break the mechanism.
Break the Harmonic Gate.
Break the PD-Chain.
Break the 3-6-9 Identity Field.

The system is presented without obfuscation or security through obscurity.
Its structures and harmonics are deterministic and constitutional.

Test it.
Model it.
Attack it.
Interrogate it.

If you break it, you reveal a flaw in the sovereign model.
If you cannot, the mechanism stands as published.
