Preamble:

Truth is the originating constant of the Agile Exchange.
It is not computed, derived, interpreted, or reasoned into existence.
It is the state that precedes all systems, all intelligence, all authority, and all mechanism.

Truth exists independent of recognition.
Truth defines identity, boundary, and equivalence.
Truth cannot be amended, shaped, influenced, corrected, or extended by any participant, device, or ledger.

The Agile Exchange is built upon a single, non-negotiable principle:

Truth is the sovereign anchor of all computation, all validation, and all exchange.

Truth is the beginning of the system.
Truth is the measure of the system.
Truth is the limit of the system.
Truth is the final state of the system.
